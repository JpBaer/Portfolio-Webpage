          I am Jorgen Baertsch, a front-end developer with an emphasis on app-development and machine learning and a background in aerospace and audio engineering.  I graduated from University of Colorado Boulder with a bachelors degree in Aerospace Engineering in 2018 and spent 3 years working for a small aerospace company as a Systems Engineer.  At this job I worked with customers to develop requirements for the programs and created proposals for the sale and use of Fast-Steering Mirrors.  During the beginning of the covid pandemic I made a move to Seattle to be with family and pursue my passion of music.  I am now currently working part time as a Mixing and Recording Engineer at Lost Boys Recording Studios in downtown Seattle and am enrolled in the Full-stack Development Bootcamp with University of Washington.  
<br>
<br>
          Through this program I have gained skills in multiple Javascript based frameworks including NodeJS, Express, SQL MongoDB and React with a primary focus on the MERN stack.  I have built multiple projects that utilize external and internal REST API's connected with a SQL or MongoDB database to provide an interactive experience for users. My technical experience through aerospace and my love for complex problem solving has given me a strong affinity for back-end engineering, however, I am compotent at both the front-end, back-end, and the integration of the two.  Outside of my bootcamp I have also been passionately learning other languages and frameworks such as Python, C#/.Net, Vue.
<br>
          I am currently searching for a junior software developer role that will allow me to showcase my skills and to expand on my current knowledge base.
